	<b>General Description:</b><br>
	<br>
	The aircraft window has a main section, where you can setup the frame type, propulsion type, aircraft performance and some generic settings, 
	like range, service ceiling etc.<br>
	<br>
	You will also find there the cost section and weight informations. The numeric stepper for engine is disabled until
	you add "Multiple Engines" as a special characteristic.<br>
	<br>
	Furthermore	3 sub-pages are in this window: <i>Crew/Specials</i>, <i>Weapons</i> and <i>Armor</i>.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Frame Types and Propulsion Types:</b><br>
	<br>
	You can choose here between varios type combinations. The porpulsion type rotor is linked to the autogyro frame type, 
	and is automaticly selected if you choos autogyro as frame.<br>
	<br>
	The frame type bomber is disabled until we found expedient bomber rules. I know there are some different rules floating
	around the net, the most common is the rule with negative BTNs. But we don't like it cause it makes not sense that
	the largest target a zeppelin gas cell has a BTN of 1 while a bomber for example has a BTN of -5.<br>
	<br>
	The "double" propulsion type is also disabled until we finished a new damage grid. Double propulsion is a combination
	of pusher and tractor.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Aircraft Performance:</b><br>
	<br>
	The Basic stats of any aircraft. The payload is linked to the BTN and also the free weight, which is the cargo space
	of an aircraft.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Crew / Specials:</b><br>
	<br>
	In this tab you can choose a pilot for your aircraft and add special charactersistics.
	To add a characteristic simply choose one from the dropdown list and push the "+" button. 
	Now the new characteristic appears below, if you want to remove it again just push "-" button behind the charactersistic.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
		
	
	<b>Weapons:</b><br>
	<br>
	In this tap you can add your guns, addjust the rocket hardpoints and choose a loadout.
	<br>
	<br>
	If you want to add a turret, first select heavy fighter as frame type and select the "has Turret" radio button.
	Now the turret radio buttons for each gunpoint are active und you can select them.
	<br>
	<br>
	If you want to fire link or ammo link the weapons, you have to add the "Fire-Linked-Weapons" or "Linked-Ammo-Bins" 
	characteristic before. This unlocks the radio buttons and numeric steppers.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
		
	<b>Armor:</b><br>
	<br>
	This tab is for adding armorpoints. First add some armor points and then distribute them on the different sections. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
		
	<b>Importing an Aircraft Blueprint:</b><br>
	<br>
	In the <i>Crew/Specials</i> page you will find the import button. Use a transparent GIF or PNG size 465x328 pixel (72dpi). 
	Draw your lines in black or gray and leave the rest transparent. 
	The orginal image is later used for printing the flavor sheet and your image will be converted into white color for the editor view.
