	<b>Options Page:</b><br>
	Right after your first start you should open the Option page and configure the rules you want to use.
	There are also options for printing.<br>
	<br>
	<i>Use Feat Rules for Pilots:</i><br>
	This enables/disables the language and feat drop-down-menus in the pilot window.<br>
	<br>
	
	<i>Use Max. Aircraft Characteristics:</i><br>
	This enables/disables the validation of the maximum aircraft characteristics,
	which is loaded from the aircraftConfigs.ae file.<br>
	<br>
	
	<i>Modified Rocket Hardpoint Mass Reduction:</i><br>
	The official rule is that each RHP that is removed, reduces the weight of 10 lbs. The preset custom rules
	reduces the weight of 125 lbs. (which is the FF5 housrule). You can adjust the custom value if you change the
	ruleConfigs.ae file. How you do that is described <a href="event:advanced.html">here</a>.<br>
	<br>
	
	<i>Print Aircraft Flavor Sheet:</i><br>
	If this option is checked, you print also the flavor sheet.<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Using the FF5 Loadout Housrule:</b><br>
	<br>
	If you look into to the "data" sub-directory you will find 3 different baseData files.<br>
	<li>baseData.ae</li>
	<li>baseData.orgbackup.ae</li>
	<li>baseData.ff5backup.ae</li>
	<br>
	Only the first one is used currently by Aeronaut. The other two are backups. The two backup files
	differ only in the rocket section. "orgbackup" uses the official slot spaces for rockets and
	"ff5back" uses the FF5 houserule.<br>
	<br>
	So if you want to use the houserule, just delete baseData.ae, copy baseData.ff5backup.ae and rename it
	to baseData.ae. Now restart Aeronaut and you can add more rockets to your slots.<br>
	<br>
	<b>But keep in mind:<br>
	Loadouts from these different rule sets are incompatible!!</b>
			
	<b>Using the Custom Airframe Rules:</b><br>
	<br>
	Since Version 1.1.0 there is a new xml file "aircraftConfigs.ae".
	There you can change anything related to aircrafts.<br>
	For editing the file look <a href="event:advanced.html">here</a>.
