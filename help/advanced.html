	<b>Working with XML</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	All Data in Aeronaut is stored in AE files, that are nothing more than XML files.
	This means you can open and edit these files with an editor that can handle an UTF-8
	encoding. <br>
	<br>
	You will find all AE Files in the "data" sub-directory. There you will also find the aeronaut.xsd
	a XML Schema file that can be used to validate your changes, if you have a XML editor at hand.<br>
	<br>
	But the most important thing is:<br>
	<b>Don't forget to backup these files before you change them!</b>	
</p>
<br><br>


<p class="Text">
	<b>Editing BaseData.ae</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	The "baseData.ae" file stores, most of the basic informations:
	<li>Companies</li>
	<li>Countries</li>
	<li>Languages</li>
	<li>Feats</li>
	<li>Weapons (Guns, Ammunition and Rocket-like stuff)</li>
	<li>Aircraft Charactaristics (aka. Special characteristic)</li>
	<br>
	So if you want to add for example new weapons or characteristics you start here. There are three different baseData files in the
	data directory. Only "baseData.ae" is used by the programm, the other two are backups.<br>
	<br>
	The best way to add new elements to your base data file is to copy a tag-block and add it to the end of it's section.<br>
	<br>
	Here you will find a description of the most important tag-blocks:<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	
	
	<i>Company Tag:</i><br>
	<span class="Code">
	&lt;company ID="C_001"&gt;<br>
		&lt;shortName>Bell&lt;/shortName&gt;<br>
		&lt;longName>Bell Aircraft Corporation&lt;/longName&gt;<br>
	&lt;/company&gt;<br><br>
	</span>
	The Companies are used in the aircraft window to fill the manufacturer list. 
	The attribute "ID" has to be unique.
	The "longName" tag is shown in the manufacturer list and the "shortName" tag is used as a prefix
	for the aircrafts name in the print sheet.
	<br>

	</span>
	<br>
	The contries are used in the pilot window for choosing a nationality for your pilot. 
	The attribute "ID" has to be unique.
	The attribute "languageID" is a reference to the mother tongue spooken in this country.
	The attribute "srcFlag" is the file name of the national flag. All Flags are stored in 
	"\images\nations\" sub-directory.

	If you use the Feat rules you can choose from this list in the pilot window.
	The attribute "ID" has to be unique.	
	The attribute "maxLevel" describes how many levels a feat has. Some feats have no levels. so this value is set to 0.
	But if it has 2 levels you set this value to 2. 
	The attribute "xpCost" stores the experience costs per level, if your feat has non levels only a single number is necessary.
	If your feat has for example 3 levels than you write your costs like this 50,100,150. The first value is the cost for level 1
	the secound value is for level 2 and so on.
	<br>

	<b>Editing AircraftConfigs.ae</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	This file was added with Version 1.1.0.
	The "aircraftConfigs.ae" file defines the different matrices for calculating costs and weights of an aircraft.
	Also it defines the frame types what is allowed and what not.
	So now every aspect of basic costs and weight can be customized for house rules.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<i>Base Target Matrix:</i><br>
	<span class="Code">
	&lt;baseTarget indexID="1"  BTN="1" loadedWeight="14500" payload="10000" cost="0"  maxSC="11" /&gt;

	TODO
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<i>Max Speed Matrix:</i><br>
	<span class="Code">
	&lt;maxSpeed btnID="1" speed="1"  weight="700" cost="470" /&gt;
	</span>
	TODO
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<i>Max Gs Matrix:</i><br>
	<span class="Code">
	&lt;maxGForce btnID="1" g="1" weight="1100" cost="510" /&gt;

			&gt;<br>
				&lt;allowedProp propType="pusher"/&gt;<br>
					1-n ...<br>
	&lt;/frameDef&gt;<br>
	</span>
	First you can't add new frame types by your own yet, but modify the exiting ones.
	The attribute "allowsTurrets" can be 0,1 or 2:<br>
		0 = no <br>
		1 = may have <br> 
		2 = only turrets allowed <br>
