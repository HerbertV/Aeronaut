	<b>Working with XML</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	All Data in Aeronaut is stored in AE files, that are nothing more than XML files.
	This means you can open and edit these files with an editor that can handle an UTF-8
	encoding. <br>
	<br>
	You will find all AE Files in the "data" sub-directory. There you will also find the aeronaut.xsd
	a XML Schema file that can be used to validate your changes, if you have a XML editor at hand.<br>
	<br>
	But the most important thing is:<br>
	<b>Don't forget to backup these files before you change them!</b>	
</p>
<br><br>


<p class="Text">
	<b>Editing BaseData.ae</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	The "baseData.ae" file stores, most of the basic informations:
	<li>Companies</li>
	<li>Countries</li>
	<li>Languages</li>
	<li>Feats</li>
	<li>Weapons (Guns, Ammunition and Rocket-like stuff)</li>
	<li>Aircraft Charactaristics (aka. Special characteristic)</li>
	<br>
	So if you want to add for example new weapons or characteristics you start here. There are three different baseData files in the
	data directory. Only "baseData.ae" is used by the programm, the other two are backups.<br>
	<br>
	The best way to add new elements to your base data file is to copy a tag-block and add it to the end of it's section.<br>
	<br>
	Here you will find a description of the most important tag-blocks:<br>

	<b>Editing AircraftConfigs.ae</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	This file was added with Version 1.1.0.
	The "aircraftConfigs.ae" file defines the different matrices for calculating costs and weights of an aircraft.
	Also it defines the frame types what is allowed and what not.
	So now every aspect of basic costs and weight can be customized for house rules.
